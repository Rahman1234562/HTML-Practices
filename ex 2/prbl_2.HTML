    <h2>Early life and family</h2>
    <p>
      Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.<sup>[5]</sup> Though some
      sources state he was born on 25 November 1952,[6] Khan has said that this
      mistake stemmed from that date being written erroneously on his
      passport.[7] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil
      engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.<sup
